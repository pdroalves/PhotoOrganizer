# PhotoOrganizer
This scripts categorizes your photos into folders throught two strategies:

1 - If your image has EXIF information, take the day it was taken.
2 - Try to read the shoot day on the file name. It expects that it has the format (day)_(anything else).(jpg,png). I.e.: 2015-06-01_16-30.jpg.

We would be glad to have more strategies. Feel welcome to contribute.

# How to use it

1 - Certify yourself that folder_split.sh has execution permission.
2 - In the folder where are the files, run folder_split.sh and see the magic happens.
